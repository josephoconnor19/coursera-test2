	<h1>Constitution</h1>
<p>Article I - Name: The University of Kansas Club Tennis</p>
<p>Article II - Purpose: The purpose of the KU Tennis Club is to give students on campus a place to share their passion for tennis in a positive, fun and competitive environment, while promoting a healthy and active lifestyle that is often lost in college. Club tennis also allows KU students to meet one another and travel to schools all across the country.</p>
<p>Article III - Membership: Any student currently enrolled at the University of Kansas is eligible to participate. We will max out at 20 women and 20 men due to court restrictions. However, the travel team will only consist of 4 women and 4 men and will be chosen by the officers. Those who are not on the current travel team are still highly encouraged to come out to bi-weekly practice and maybe earn a spot on the travel roster. In order to obtain full membership, students must meet the following requirements: enrollment of at least 6 credit hours, payment of dues (amount is based on the number of members and voted upon by the officers), and completion of required forms by the university (Rec Services Liability Waiver and dosportseasy.com/kuclubsports). Full members are students who are on the travel team. Those who are not on the travel team are not required to pay full membership fees unless they later retain full membership later in the season. Students who are not full members are required to pay their share of the balls, court time, and team apparel.</p>
<p>Article IV - Meetings: At least three meetings a semester will be held for the officers to discuss upcoming events and possible changes to improve the experience of members. If a special meeting is needed, then officers will find time to meet based on personal schedules.</p>
<p>Article V - Officers: There will be five officers (2 presidents, 2 vice presidents, and a treasurer). All officers will be required to attend meetings where scheduling and planning will take place.
Presidents - The presidents are in charge of the entire club team. They will deal with the communications with other schools in order to set up tournaments and dual matches. Presidents will make sure that fellow members make the deadlines as well as keep the rest of the team updated with team activities via email and text message.
Vice-Presidents - Vice presidents are required to assist the presidents in anything that needs to be done and making sure that tasks are being completed promptly. The vice-presidents will be required to deal with all of the paperwork involved with registration with the university and USTA. The vice president will assist with travel plans along with organizing fund raisers and events. 
Treasurer - The treasurer is in charge of everything dealing with the finances of the club. The treasurer manages the team’s budget, bank account, and dues paid by the players. All purchases are made through the treasurer, who makes sure to gain approval from the Sports Club Coordinator. The treasurer also assists the president and vice-president in anything that needs to be done.</p>
<p>Article VI - Elections: Elections will take place at the conclusion of each year to pick the officers for the following year. Each presidential candidate will have a vice-presidential candidate running with him or her, and the treasurer will run by his or herself. Officers from the previous year are eligible for reelection. All members coming back the next year will be required to vote, therefore, making 100% of the paid members vote. The vote will take place via email or at the last practice of the year. Each member will be required to vote for two president/vice-president combos.</p>
<p>Article VII - Funds
Dues: Dues will be $200 which will include the cost of balls, court time, dual matches, regionals, nationals, and team shirts. Those who are not on the travel team will not pay for the match costs, however, they will be required to pay for balls, team shirts, and court time.
Fundraisers: Fundraisers will be held once a year in order to generate extra cash for operation costs. We are planning on doing a bake sale at the beginning of the school year. Our goal for the bake sale is $150 which is already factored into the budget. Money earned from the fundraiser will be deposited to the Sofas account by the treasurer.</p>
<p>Article VIII - Advisor: The advisor is to be a member of the University of Kansas Faculty and is chosen by the officers. The advisor must be easy to contact in case of emergencies or when papers are needed to be signed for the USTA or Club Sports. The team and the advisor must have a good relationship in order to reach the ideals of Club Sports at the University of Kansas.</p>
<p>Article IX - Coaches: The club tennis team will be self coached by the players. The lineup for the travel team will be decided by the members of the travel team. All other decisions will be handled by the officers.</p>
<p>Article X - Bylaws: Bylaws will be proposed and voted on by a year to year basis. Bylaws will be proposed by the officers in order to improve the experience of the members of the team based on the previous year. The bylaws will then be voted on by the team requiring a two-thirds vote with 50% of the paying members present.</p>
<p>Article XI - Amendment: Amendments can be presented by any of the officers. However, if any of the officers object, then the amendment in question must be ratified by a two-thirds majority of the team members to become approved.</p>
<p>Article XII - Travel: Prior to traveling, a form of intent must be completed and turned in by all players in the club wanting to compete. The travel roster will consist of four men and four women determined by the officers based on commitment to the team (practice time) and whoever is deemed most likely to do well at the tournament (challenge matches).
One Day Travel:
If the travel roster is playing a single day dual match/tournament at a nearby school/facility, then the players themselves will be responsible for transportation. To ensure that all teammates arrive on-time, carpooling will be encouraged. Reimbursement for gas will be dependent on whether the budget allows it. In the case that it does not, the players in each car will be expected to help pay for gas.
    2.    Overnight/Weekend Travel: 
In the case of a dual match/tournament that requires one or more nights, transportation and sleeping arrangements will be planned out weeks in advance by the officers. The Sofas account will be used to pay for transportation and lodging. All other expenses such as food and personal items will be paid for by the individual players. The treasurer will be mainly responsible for making sure there is money in the bank for emergency purchases.</p>
<p>Article XIII - Responsibilities of Club/Members: Each member of the club will be expected to understand that he/she will be representing the University of Kansas and must do so in a professional manner. Members will be expected to follow any rules in place by this Constitution, KU Recreation Services, other facilities/teams, and by Sports Club Policies (outlined in Sport Club Handbook). If rules are violated by club members, punishment will be determined by officers based on the severity of the infraction, ranging from no traveling to removal from the team without refunds. Infractions can be reported to a Club officer or any other KU Recreation staff member. Appeals must be made in writing to the Sport Club Executive Board within 48 hours (delivered to the Sport Club Director). 
An “Inside the Lines” infraction (during competition/practice) can be reported by any club member to an officer within 24 hours of the violation. If a state or federal law or KU Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities is violated, then the member can be indefinitely suspended from club activity until the issue is cleared/resolved. Should a violation be reported to an officer, that officer is then responsible for contacting the Sport Club or Recreation Services staff within three days. A hearing will be held within 15 business days of the reporting of said violation which will include the Presidents, the reporter, and the violator. The results of the hearing, in writing, will be sent to the Sport Club or Recreation Services staff within 5 business days. An appeal by a member of the club to the Sport Club Executive Board must be made in writing within 48 hours of the results. The appeal will be delivered to the Sport Club Director. Appeals of the Sport Club Executive Board decision must be made, in writing, within 48 hours to the Recreation Advisory Board. The appeal should be delivered to the Director of KU Recreation Services.
“Outside the Lines” (incidents that can happen by the club when not competing/practicing but could reflect upon the club/University negatively) infractions will be reviewed by the officers and punishments will be determined based on the severity of the infraction. Violations will be defined by a level similar to what is used in the Sport Club Handbook. Any club member can report an incident to a club officer, KU Recreation Services staff member, KU Ombudsman, or the Office of the Vice Provost for Student Success. The incident will then be addressed as deemed appropriate by staff.</p>
<p>Article XIV - Refund Procedures: Refunds will only be issued should a member quit within one month of the beginning of the season, if a member is cut within one month of the beginning of the season, or if a player is injured within one month of the beginning of the season. Members who are expelled from the club for any reason will not be refunded.</p>
<p>Article XV - Hazing: 
The club has a zero tolerance for any form of hazing as stated in the KU Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities (http://policy.ku.edu/sites/policy.ku.edu/files/Code_of_Student_Rights_11.14.pdf). Article 19, #9 states that “Hazing includes, but is not limited to, any action, activity or situation which recklessly, negligently or intentionally endangers the mental or physical health, welfare or safety of a person, creates excessive fatigue, sleep deprivation, mental or physical discomfort, exposes a person to extreme embarrassment or ridicule, involves personal servitude, destroys or removes public or private property, or implicitly or explicitly interferes with the academic requirements or responsibilities of a student. It is presumed that hazing is a forced activity regardless of the apparent willingness of an individual to participate in the activity. Apathy or acquiescence in the presence of hazing is not neutral; both are violations of this rule.”
